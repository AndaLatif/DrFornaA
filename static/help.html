        Input format:
The following text is a slice of valid input for DrFrona. It is a white-space separated value (``csv-like'') table, where the header must contain five fields with the names id time occupancy structure energy.

Frontend interactions:
The output shown contains the visual output for a selected time point (marked with the red line on the time scale):

each structure is shown in the rectangle marked with the ID of the structure in the corner.
the size of each rectangle will be proportional to the occupancy of the corresponding structure at the selected time point.
each nucleotide will be colored according to the helix it is part of, while unpaired nucleotides remain uncolored.
the black line on the time scale marks the end of transciption, which splits the scale into the linear cotranscriptional time scale and the logarithmic scale for time steps after the end of transcription.
for each time point, the vertical section of the colors shown on the scale correspond to the nucleotide colors of the most occupied structure present at the selected time point.
a summary of the content of the file for the selected timepoint will be shown as a table. Each nucleotide of the structure (in dot bracket notation) will be also colored according to the helix it is part of. The id of the most occupied structure for that particular time point will be also marked in the table.
In the area of the time scale, you can activate or deactivate the mouse with a click. When the mouse is active, you can move the mouse left or right to select a time point interactively.

The Play/Pause starts the animation: the structures are shown for every time point in the input file. These were marked with small circles on the time scale. The animation can be deactivated either by clicking the button again or by a mouse click on the scale area.
